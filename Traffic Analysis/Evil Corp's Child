In order to find the executable , using wireshark go to file -> export objects -> http
Doing so we get this :

Great,now we have a png image to work with.However trying to view it we get this:

Running

  > file pictures4.png 

reveals this :

  > picture4.png: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows

The picture is actually an .exe file . Lets try to change its suffix to .exe :

  >mv picture4.png picture4.exe

Lets run the md5sum to get the flag.

  > md5sum picture4.exe 

Thus we get our flag : flag{a95d24937acb3420ee94493db298b295}
